# freeswitch_log_parser
Parses freeswitch logs for calls

It is in very early phase of development.
TO DO: 
1. get call route
2. get actions which are executed for each call
3. take params from command line to get one call 
4. get reason of end of call 


Run script and set in command line path to parsed file. 

For example: 

`ruby app.rb /path/to/freeswitch.log`
